# Project: SQL Zoo
This project will test the student’s domain of SQL queries by requesting them to retrieve and organize different pieces of data from a table of SQL Zoo.
SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions.
